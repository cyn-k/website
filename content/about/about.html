<h3>Disney</h3>
<p>I am a h u g e Disney fan! During my sophomore year, I participated in the Disney College Program and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I learned so much about myself, my work ethic, and the impact other people have on me. Disney’s motto is “We create happiness,” and that is something I strive to live by every day. I loved my time at Disney so much, that I hope to work for the Walt Disney Company as part of their Animals, Science, and Environment team. Here is a picture of my friends and I celebrating the holidays at Disney! We actually made Christmas cards and sent them to all of our managers!

<h3>Little Cause-Players</h3>
<p>For the past three years, I have been part of a non-profit charity and student organization called Little Cause-Players. We perform as popular fictional characters for children at Dell Children’s Hospital and other community events. The character I get to “hang out” with is Anna from Frozen. This org has brought me an endless amount of joy and let me live my dream of being a princess. Here are a few of our characters!
